                                <p>
                                    The <em>Yi Jing</em>, often transilliterated as <em>I Ching</em>, is one of the oldest of the Chinese Classic texts. 
                                    Commonly it is translated as the Book of Changes, it has been used as a divination tool 
                                </p>

                        <h2>What is an Oracle?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Like to <em>Orate</em>, to speak of knowledge of something. Something with answers
                            to questions and queries. Oracles may often hold a <q>mystical</q> association for many 
                            people. The ability of something outside of ourselves to answer questions that come from 
                            within ourselves is a spiritual concept that each person carries different belief structures 
                            about. Some point to God, some point to Tao, some don't point, some point to universal 
                            scientific laws. Whether it is chance or it is destiny, it changes, and changes continue 
                            to changlessly change.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If we can begin to look at oracles as a tool to get 
                            to know oneself, we can begin to find answers for the questions we have. 
                            Oracles are found and created when we focus on questions 
                            and start listening to the truth inside ourselves.
                        </p>

                            Heed these words, you who wish to probe the depths of nature. If you do not find within 
                            yourself that which you seek, neither will you find it outside yourself. If you ignore the 
                            wonders of your own house, how do you expect to find other wonders? in you is hidden the 
                            treasure of treasures. Know thyself, and you will know the universe and the gods. -
